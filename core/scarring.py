scarring.py - Memory formation through parameter modification

"Scarring" means: when a pattern successfully forms, we modify the substrate's
physical parameters (F and K) to make that pattern easier to form in the future.

This is fundamentally different from weight-based learning:
- Neural networks: Store patterns in connection weights
- Parametric scarring: Store patterns in the physics itself

    Modify substrate parameters where current state matches target.

    The scarring rule:
    1. Find regions where both V and target are active (match_map)
    2. Increase F (feed rate) in those regions
    3. Decrease K (kill rate) in those regions
    4. Keep F and K within valid bounds

    This makes the pattern "easier" to form - the physics now favors it.
