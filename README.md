**Teaching patterns to physics: How substrate modification enables memory formation in continuous dynamical systems**

This repository contains code for experiments demonstrating **parametric scarring**‚Äîa memory mechanism where learned patterns are encoded as permanent modifications to the physical parameters governing a reaction-diffusion substrate.

## Key Results

- **93.3% recall accuracy** from 15% perturbation strength
- **2.86√ó improvement** over baseline (no scarring)
- **3 distinct patterns** stored simultaneously with >80% recall quality
- **Zero catastrophic forgetting** across sequential training

## What is Parametric Scarring?

Instead of storing memories as weights in a neural network, we modify the **laws of physics** themselves. When a pattern is learned successfully, we adjust the reaction-diffusion parameters (f and k) locally, creating "scars" that make that pattern easier to recreate in the future.

**Key insight**: Memory as substrate modification, not just weight adjustment.

## Quick Start

### Installation

```bash
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/parametric-scarring.git
cd parametric-scarring

# Create virtual environment (recommended, double recommend you use `uv` of course)
uv venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .\venv\Scripts\activate on CMD or .\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1 via PowerShell

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Run Experiments

**Full validation experiment** (Phases 1-3, <5 minutes on a cheap GPU):
```bash
python scarring_validation.py
```

Results saved to `scarring_results/`:
- Training/recall visualizations (PNG)
- Parameter scar maps (PNG)
- Quantitative metrics (JSON)
- Summary plots (PNG)

## How It Works

### 1. Substrate: Gray-Scott Reaction-Diffusion

Two chemicals (U and V) diffuse and react across a 2D grid:

```
‚àÇU/‚àÇt = Du‚àá¬≤U - UV¬≤ + f(1-U)
‚àÇV/‚àÇt = Dv‚àá¬≤V + UV¬≤ - (k+f)V
```

Parameters `f` and `k` control pattern formation (spots, stripes, mazes, etc.).

### 2. Scarring Algorithm

```python
def apply_scarring(V, target, F, K, strength=0.003):
    """Modify F/K where current state matches target"""
    match_map = (V > 0.3) & (target > 0.3)
    F[match_map] += strength          # Increase feed rate
    K[match_map] -= strength * 0.5    # Decrease kill rate
    F.clamp_(0.01, 0.08)
    K.clamp_(0.03, 0.08)
```

### 3. Memory Recall

From weak perturbation (15% of target), the scarred substrate reconstructs the full pattern with 93% accuracy.

---

## Experiments

### Phase 1: Single Pattern Training
- Train pattern with/without scarring
- Control collapses to mazes (11.8% similarity)
- Scarred maintains pattern (51.5% similarity)

### Phase 2: Memory Recall
- Weak (15%) perturbation ‚Üí full reconstruction
- Scarred: 93.3% recall quality
- Control: 32.6% recall quality

### Phase 3: Multiple Patterns
- Train 3 patterns sequentially
- All recalled above 80% quality
- Minimal interference between patterns

## Limitations

This is early-stage proof-of-concept research. Known limitations:

- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Pattern complexity**: Only tested on simple geometric patterns
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Capacity**: Unknown how many patterns can be stored before interference
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Temporal sequences**: Cannot learn A‚ÜíB‚ÜíC transitions yet
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Real-world data**: Audio/visual features untested
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Scalability**: 256√ó256 grid has limited representational capacity

See blog post for detailed discussion.
